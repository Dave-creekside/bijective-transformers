    "# 🚀 Bijective Discrete Diffusion for Text Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "## World's First Self-Contained Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a groundbreaking **bijective discrete diffusion model** for text generation with **exact likelihood computation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Key Features:\n",
    "- **Bijective Transformers**: Invertible attention and feed-forward layers\n",
    "- **Exact Likelihood**: No variational approximations needed\n",
    "- **Real Data Training**: WikiText-2 dataset\n",
    "- **Self-Contained**: No external dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "**Just click \"Run All\" to train your own bijective diffusion model! 🎉**"
