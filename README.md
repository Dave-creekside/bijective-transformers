## 🎯 What This Is

A complete implementation of bijective discrete diffusion models for text generation that provides:

- ✅ **Exact likelihood computation** (not variational bounds)
- ✅ **Mathematically invertible** transformer architecture  
- ✅ **Advanced sampling** with anti-mask bias to prevent repetitive generation
- ✅ **Complete checkpoint system** with save/load/resume functionality
- ✅ **Cross-platform support** (M3 Mac, CUDA workstations, Google Colab)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Google Colab (Easiest)
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/your-username/bijective-transformers/blob/main/Bijective_Discrete_Diffusion_Colab_Fixed.ipynb)

### Option 2: Local Training
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bijective-transformers.git
cd bijective-transformers
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Train with automatic checkpointing
python train_bijective_with_checkpoints.py --epochs 10

# Resume from latest checkpoint
python train_bijective_with_checkpoints.py --resume latest --epochs 20
```

### Option 3: Workstation (2x RTX 4070)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bijective-transformers.git
cd bijective-transformers

# Docker deployment with multi-GPU support
docker-compose up -d bijective-training
docker exec -it bijective-training python train_bijective_workstation.py
```

```bash
# Training progress example
Epoch 1: Loss 12.96 → Epoch 10: Loss 6.23
✅ Checkpoint saved: models/checkpoints/epoch_010_loss_6.23.pt
🏆 Best model: models/checkpoints/best_model.pt
📈 Validation perplexity: 1154 → 387 (improving)
```

## 🛠️ Usage Examples

### Basic Training
```python
from src.models.bijective_diffusion_fixed import BijectiveDiscreteDiffusionModel
from src.utils.checkpoint import create_checkpoint_manager

# Create model with checkpointing
model = BijectiveDiscreteDiffusionModel(config)
checkpoint_manager = create_checkpoint_manager()

# Train with automatic saves
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    # ... training loop ...
    if checkpoint_manager.should_save_checkpoint(epoch):
        checkpoint_manager.save_checkpoint(model, optimizer, scheduler, epoch, loss, config)
```

### Resume Training
```python
# Resume from latest checkpoint
latest_checkpoint = checkpoint_manager.get_latest_checkpoint()
epoch, loss, config = checkpoint_manager.load_checkpoint(model, optimizer, scheduler, latest_checkpoint)
print(f"Resumed from epoch {epoch}, loss {loss:.4f}")
```

### Model Export
```python
# Export trained model for inference
export_path = checkpoint_manager.export_model(model, config, "my_trained_model")
print(f"Model exported to: {export_path}")
```
