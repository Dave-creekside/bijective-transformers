# Complete Project Handoff Document

## Executive Summary - Start Here

**Project Goal**: Test whether bijective modular systems improve non-autoregressive text generation (specifically diffusion-based LLMs) by providing exact likelihood computation and perfect information preservation.

**Core Hypothesis**: Bijective transformations will improve denoising quality in discrete diffusion models for text, unlike in autoregressive models where they empirically failed.

**Success Criteria**: Measurable improvement in text generation quality (BLEU, perplexity) and/or training efficiency compared to standard transformer baselines.

**Timeline**: 8-12 weeks for complete implementation and evaluation.

# Technical Foundation

## Mathematical Core

### Bijective Functions
- **Definition**: f: X → Y where f is both injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto)
- **Composition**: (g ∘ f)⁻¹ = f⁻¹ ∘ g⁻¹
- **Likelihood**: log p(x) = log p(f(x)) + log|det(Jf(x))|
- **Key property**: Perfect information preservation

### Discrete Diffusion Process
- **Forward**: Clean text → Corrupted text (via masking, substitution, deletion)
- **Reverse**: Corrupted text → Clean text (learned denoising)
- **Training**: Learn reverse process on pairs (corrupted, clean)
- **Inference**: Start from noise, iteratively denoise

### Why This Combination Makes Sense
- Diffusion already conceptually invertible (forward/reverse)
- Bijective modules could make this mathematically exact
- Non-autoregressive allows parallel processing (compatible with bijective constraints)
- Information preservation critical for high-quality denoising

# Implementation Architecture

## Core Components

### 1. Bidirectional Transformer Backbone
```python
# Key differences from GPT:
# - No causal masking in attention
# - Can attend to entire sequence context
# - Similar to BERT but for generation
```

### 2. Coupling Layers (Bijective Core)
```python
# Basic coupling layer structure:
# x1, x2 = split(x)
# y1 = x1
# y2 = x2 + neural_net(x1)  # additive coupling
# y = concat(y1, y2)
# 
# Inverse:
# y1, y2 = split(y)
# x1 = y1
# x2 = y2 - neural_net(y1)
# x = concat(x1, x2)
```

### 3. Time Embedding for Diffusion
```python
# Sinusoidal embeddings encoding noise level
# Added to token embeddings
# Tells model "how corrupted is this input"
```

### 4. Discrete Noise Process
```python
# Text corruption strategies:
# - Random masking: tokens → [MASK]
# - Substitution: tokens → random vocabulary items
# - Deletion/insertion: remove/add random tokens
```

## Architecture Decision Tree

### Choice 1: Where to Apply Bijective Constraints
**Option A**: Replace entire transformer blocks with coupling layers
**Option B**: Make only residual connections bijective
**Option C**: Hybrid - some layers bijective, others standard

**Recommendation**: Start with Option C for easier debugging

### Choice 2: Coupling Strategy for Discrete Tokens
**Option A**: Work in continuous embedding space, maintain discrete outputs
**Option B**: Design discrete-native coupling operations
**Option C**: Use continuous coupling with discretization layers

**Recommendation**: Option A - leverage existing continuous coupling methods

### Choice 3: Memory vs Computation Trade-off
**Option A**: Store all activations (high memory, fast backward)
**Option B**: Recompute via inverse functions (low memory, slow backward)
**Option C**: Gradient checkpointing with strategic storage

**Recommendation**: Option C with careful profiling

    def __init__(self, embed_dim, hidden_dim):
        super().__init__()
        self.embed_dim = embed_dim
        self.split_dim = embed_dim // 2
        
        # Neural network for coupling function
        self.coupling_net = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(self.split_dim, hidden_dim),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(hidden_dim, hidden_dim),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(hidden_dim, self.split_dim)
        )
    
    def forward(self, x):
        # x shape: [batch, seq_len, embed_dim]
        x1, x2 = torch.split(x, self.split_dim, dim=-1)
        y1 = x1
        y2 = x2 + self.coupling_net(x1)
        return torch.cat([y1, y2], dim=-1)
    
    def inverse(self, y):
        y1, y2 = torch.split(y, self.split_dim, dim=-1)
        x1 = y1
        x2 = y2 - self.coupling_net(y1)
        return torch.cat([x1, x2], dim=-1)
```

### Invertibility Testing
```python
def test_invertibility(layer, x, tolerance=1e-6):
    y = layer(x)
    x_reconstructed = layer.inverse(y)
    error = torch.norm(x - x_reconstructed).item()
    assert error < tolerance, f"Invertibility error: {error}"
    return error
```

## Memory Management Strategy

```python
class BijectiveCheckpoint(torch.autograd.Function):
    @staticmethod
    def forward(ctx, function, *inputs):
        ctx.function = function
        with torch.no_grad():
            outputs = function(*inputs)
        return outputs
    
    @staticmethod
    def backward(ctx, *grad_outputs):
        # Recompute forward pass for gradients
        inputs = ctx.saved_tensors
        with torch.enable_grad():
            outputs = ctx.function(*inputs)
        return torch.autograd.grad(outputs, inputs, grad_outputs)
```

### Memory Monitoring
```python
def profile_memory_usage(model, input_batch):
    torch.cuda.reset_peak_memory_stats()
    initial_memory = torch.cuda.memory_allocated()
    
    output = model(input_batch)
    peak_memory = torch.cuda.max_memory_allocated()
    
    return {
        'initial': initial_memory,
        'peak': peak_memory,
        'difference': peak_memory - initial_memory
    }
```

            'invertibility_error': [],
            'memory_usage': []
        }
    
    def log_step(self, model, loss, inputs):
        # Track training health
        grad_norm = self.compute_gradient_norm(model)
        inv_error = self.test_model_invertibility(model, inputs)
        memory = torch.cuda.memory_allocated()
        
        self.metrics['loss'].append(loss.item())
        self.metrics['gradient_norm'].append(grad_norm)
        self.metrics['invertibility_error'].append(inv_error)
