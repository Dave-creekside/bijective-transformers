# Related Work Analysis - WITH CONFIDENCE LEVELS

## High Confidence: Established Techniques

### Flow-Based Models (Normalizing Flows)
**Definitely exists and works**:
- **RealNVP** (2016): Coupling layers for images, invertible
- **Glow** (2018): Invertible 1x1 convolutions + coupling layers
- **MAF/IAF** (2017): Autoregressive flows for density modeling

**Verified properties**:
- Exact likelihood computation via change of variables
- Bijective by construction
- Good for continuous data (images, audio)

**What I don't know**: How well these adapt to discrete text tokens

### Discrete Diffusion Models
**Confirmed to exist**:
- **D3PM** (Austin et al., 2021): Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models
- **Multinomial Diffusion** (Hoogeboom et al., 2021)
- **SUNDAE** (Savinov et al., 2021): Step-wise diffusion for text

**Verified approaches**:
- Categorical noise processes
- Absorbing state diffusion (tokens â†’ [MASK])
- Uniform transition matrices

## Medium Confidence: Emerging Approaches

### Diffusion for Text Generation
**Likely exists but details uncertain**:
- **Diffusion-LM** (Li et al., 2022): Continuous diffusion in embedding space
- **SSD-LM** (Han et al., 2022): Semi-autoregressive diffusion
- **CDCD** (Dieleman et al., 2022): Continuous diffusion on sequences

**Need to verify**:
- Exact architectural details
- Performance compared to autoregressive models
- Training stability and convergence properties

### Non-Autoregressive Generation
**Established concept, uncertain implementations**:
- **BERT-style** bidirectional generation
- **Masked Language Model** fine-tuning for generation
- **Iterative refinement** approaches

**What works vs what doesn't**: Need empirical validation

## Low Confidence: My Hypotheses

### SEDD Specifically
**MAJOR UNCERTAINTY**: I described SEDD as "Score Entropy Discrete Diffusion" but I should verify:
- Does this paper/method actually exist?
- Are my architectural descriptions accurate?
- Is it actually called SEDD or something else?

**Research needed**: Find the actual paper and verify all claims

### Bijective + Discrete Text
**Pure hypothesis territory**:
- Whether coupling layers work well with token embeddings
- If bijective constraints help or hurt text generation quality
- Memory/computational tradeoffs

# Experimental Design - Testable Hypotheses

## Phase 1: Baseline Validation (HIGH PRIORITY)

### Experiment 1.1: Basic Bidirectional Text Denoising
**Goal**: Establish working baseline before adding complexity
**Method**:
- Take pretrained BERT
- Fine-tune on text reconstruction from corrupted input
- Measure reconstruction quality (BLEU, exact match)

**Success criteria**: Reasonable reconstruction performance
**Risk mitigation**: If this fails, bijective layers won't help

### Experiment 1.2: Verify Coupling Layer Invertibility
**Goal**: Ensure bijective implementation actually works
**Method**:
- Implement simple coupling layer in PyTorch
- Test: `x_reconstructed = inverse(forward(x))`
- Measure reconstruction error (should be ~0)

**Success criteria**: Perfect or near-perfect reconstruction
**Failure mode**: Implementation bugs in bijective constraints

## Phase 2: Integration Testing (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

### Experiment 2.1: Coupling Layers in Embedding Space
**Goal**: Test if coupling layers work with text embeddings
**Method**:
- Replace some transformer layers with coupling layers
- Train on same denoising task
- Compare: reconstruction quality, training speed, memory usage

**Hypothesis**: Bijective layers preserve more information
**Measurable**: BLEU scores, perplexity, exact match rates

### Experiment 2.2: Likelihood Computation Accuracy
**Goal**: Test if exact likelihoods help training
**Method**:
- Compare models with/without exact likelihood computation
- Measure training convergence, final performance
- Track loss curves and gradient norms

**Hypothesis**: Exact gradients improve optimization
**Risk**: Computational overhead might outweigh benefits

## Phase 3: Scaling Tests (LOW PRIORITY)

### Experiment 3.1: Sequence Length Scaling
**Goal**: Test if approach works on longer sequences
**Method**: Train on sequences of increasing length (128, 512, 1024 tokens)
**Concern**: Bijective memory requirements might explode

### Experiment 3.2: Generation Quality
**Goal**: Test actual text generation (not just reconstruction)
**Method**: Generate from noise, evaluate with human/automated metrics
**Risk**: Might work for reconstruction but fail for generation

# Potential Pitfalls and Detection

## Technical Pitfalls

### Memory Explosion
**Problem**: Bijective models need to store all intermediate activations
**Detection**: Monitor GPU memory usage during training
**Mitigation**: Gradient checkpointing, smaller models initially

### Training Instability
**Problem**: Bijective constraints might make optimization harder
**Detection**: Loss curves, gradient norms, NaN values
**Mitigation**: Lower learning rates, gradient clipping

### Poor Discrete Token Handling
**Problem**: Coupling layers designed for continuous data
**Detection**: Token reconstruction accuracy, semantic coherence
**Mitigation**: Better embedding strategies, hybrid approaches

## Conceptual Pitfalls

### Overfitting to Theory
**Problem**: Mathematical elegance doesn't guarantee practical benefits
**Detection**: A/B testing against simpler baselines
**Mitigation**: Always compare to non-bijective versions

### Complexity Without Benefit
**Problem**: Added complexity might not improve results
**Detection**: Performance metrics, computational cost analysis
**Mitigation**: Incremental testing, ablation studies

### Implementation Bugs Masquerading as Features
**Problem**: Bugs might accidentally improve metrics
**Detection**: Sanity checks, invertibility tests, code review
**Mitigation**: Rigorous testing of bijective properties
